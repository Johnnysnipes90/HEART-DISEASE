# HEART-DISEASE
eHealth Africa has carried out investigation on various factors that can cause heart
disease. The data on patients with the heart disease are collected in the southern and
northern part of Nigeria

This data is intended to analyze the presence of heart disease in patients. You will use
your machine learning and data science techniques for predictive modelling and risk
analysis, particularly in the healthcare sector

Data Understanding and Preprocessing
1. Data Consolidation o Are any transformations required for specific variables to
ensure they are directly comparable between the two datasets? How will these
transformations affect the analysis?
o After consolidating the datasets, what steps will be taken to validate the
integrity and accuracy of the combined data?
2. Data Cleaning
o Are there any missing values in the dataset? If so, how do you propose to handle
them?
o How would you deal with any outliers in the dataset? Justify your approach.
3. Feature Engineering
o Discuss the potential impact of categorical variables like 'Chest pain type',
'Fasting blood sugar', and 'Thallium stress test' on predicting heart disease.
o How would you preprocess these features for modelling?
4. Data Visualization
o Create visualizations to explore the relationship between age, sex, and heart
disease status.
o What insights can you derive from these visualizations regarding the risk factors
of heart disease?
o Model Development
5. Choosing Algorithms o Based on the dataset, which machine learning algorithms
would you consider for predicting heart disease status and why?
6. Feature Selection o With 13 features available, how would you select the most
important features for predicting heart disease?
o Describe any techniques you would use.
o Model Training and Evaluation
7. Cross-validation o Please explain how you would implement cross-validation in
training your model and why it's important.
8. Performance Metrics o Discuss the metrics you would use to evaluate the
performance of your heart disease prediction model. Justify your choice of metrics.
o Model Interpretation and Deployment
9. Model Insights o How would you interpret the model's predictions to provide
insights to healthcare professionals at eHealth Africa?
10.Deployment Strategy o Describe a deployment strategy for your heart disease
prediction model that ensures its reliability and effectiveness in a real-world
healthcare.
o Ethical Considerations
11. Ethical Considerations o Discuss potential biases in the dataset and their
implications for model fairness. How would you address these biases?
o Considering the sensitive nature of health data, what measures would you
recommend to ensure the privacy and security of patient data when deploying
your model?
o Reflect on the impact of your heart disease prediction model on patient care and
healthcare delivery. How would you ensure the model's use benefits patients and
supports healthcare providers in making informed decisions?
